This is my first web page, and Iâ€™m focusing on key layout principles:

Symmetry: Aligning elements evenly to create a balanced and professional design.
Padding: Adding space inside elements to make the content look clean and well-separated from the edges.
Margins: Adjusting the space around elements to ensure proper spacing and prevent them from feeling cramped or overlapping.
